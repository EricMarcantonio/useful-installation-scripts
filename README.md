# useful-installation-scripts

Constantly switching operating systems (or having the computer die on me, I need new hardware :)), I created this help me install programs that I use.

I also go a 2011 macbook that is running ubuntu, (kali is great, just as a VM. Its not where it needs to be to actually run on hardware IMHO), so I (and you!) can use these
these scripts to install programs on a new system, without going through a backup

## Usage
`git clone https://github.com/EricMarcantonio/useful-installation-scripts.git`

`cd useful-installation-scripts`

`run-parts --regex '^.*sh$' ./`
